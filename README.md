## Description

This is an questionnaire. Included is a list of questions, a results pane and a submit button.
The app also includes pictures in relation to each section mentioned.

The application is mainly based on HTML, CSS and Javascript, because they are easy to use, easy to understandand
They also build the basics of web design and are quit handy as junior developer.

## Challenges and upgrades

Lack of enough content to include in the project, although the project objectives were met.
Diversify my content with time.
Limited exposure in development hence designed a basic HTML, CSS web page and basic js .
With the continued software development training, i intend to diversify on the layouts and general usability.
